Failure modes:
    No sensor data during RNDZ and no visual acquisition
    Good sensor data during RNDZ but no visual acquisition
    Propellant quanities violate bingo numbers
    All jets in an direction fail
    Single jet fails on
    Single jet fails off

What I Need:
    From Orbital:
        How close can you get me at switch over (when do I need to start my job)?
        What will my relative position and velocity be at switch over?
    From Engines:
        What sorts of engines will I have?
        What is my minimum output/what kind of precision will I have?
    From Mechanical:
        How precisely do I need to dock? (1 inch? 1 cm?)


John - Rendez Vouz
    - develop approach strategy
        STS-135/ISS dock strategy
    - GNC for rendez-vous
        Kalman filters
    - delta V for rendez-vous
        Greatly depends on where redezvous starts
    - rendez-vous sensor selection
        GPS
        IMUs
        Star Trackers
        TRiDAR
        Stereo vision cameras


HRV should not damage the HST.
HRV should communicate with HST during rendezvous and docking.
HRV should dock with HST.
HRV should have sufficient fuel to rendezvous, dock, and undock with HST.
HRV should automatically abort docking if remaining fuel is not sufficient for docking and undocking.
HRV should be able to successfully dock despite single jet fail on.
HRV should be able to successfully dock despite single jet fail off.
HRV should be able to resume docking following a single event upset.
